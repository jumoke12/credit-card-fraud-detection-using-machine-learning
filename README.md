**Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning**

This repository contains data and scripts used to build several machine learning models for the project titled "Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning".
The data used in this project is a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 284,808 credit card transactions, of which 492 are fraudulent. The features in the dataset include the time of the transaction and the amount of the transaction.
The scripts in this repository can be used to load the data, clean the data, and train several machine learning models. The models that are included in this repository are:

Na√Øve Bayes
Decision tree
K-Nearest Neighbour
Support vector machine

The scripts also include code to evaluate the performance of the models.
The data and scripts in this repository can be used to build and evaluate new machine learning models for fraud detection.

**Getting Started**

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following software installed:

Python 3
NumPy
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

Once you have installed the necessary software, you can clone this repository and run the CreditCardFraud_imbalancedDataset.ipynb and CreditCardPrediction_SMOTE.ipynbscripts. The scripts will load the data, clean the data, and train the machine learning models.

**Results**

The results of the machine learning models are shown in the results.csv file. The file contains the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of each model.

**Conclusion**

The results of this project show that machine learning can be used to detect credit card fraud. The models that were trained in this project achieved an accuracy of 99.3%.
The data and scripts in this repository can be used to build and evaluate new machine learning models for fraud detection.
